Cpp-Util

This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

If you're interested in contributing, that would be pretty cool - let me
know and then I'll get to documenting the code and making what needs to be done
clear.

TODO:
	documentation
	inline small functions
	fibheap (check file for TODOs)
	different lfu cache implementations (see file)
	valgrind check
	Micro-optimize - save size() variables on stack, inline (research
		how getters get inlined)
