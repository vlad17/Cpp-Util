Cpp-Util

This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

Requires cmake 2.6+ and gcc 4.7+

To run tests:
cmake .
make -j
make test

TODO:
        atomic shared ptr (cas, other atomic ops)
        atomic shared ptr multithread testing.
	wait-free queue (use above atomic shared_ptr, test multithreaded).
        Create exception-based test file? Install gtest?
        create test-testandset spinlock, and then queuelock (with everyhting, Art of mpp ch.7) 
        Create assert-based tests
	concurrent heap_cache (finish testing & debugging)
	exact_heap_cache (see lfu_cache.h) - make separate method in main for comparison/stress
	linked_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	-> concurrent versions of exact_heap_cache and linked_cache
	fibheap (check file for TODOs)
	valgrind check everything
