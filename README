This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

TODO:
	wait-free queue (use above atomic shared_ptr, test multithreaded).
	concurrent heap_cache (finish testing & debugging)
	exact_heap_cache (see lfu_cache.h) - make separate method in main for comparison/stress
	linked_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	-> concurrent versions of exact_heap_cache and linked_cache
	fibheap (check file for TODOs)
	valgrind check everything
