Cpp-Util

This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

Right now I don't expect anyone to actually look at the code (professionally
made versions of these structures are available readily from boost), so it is
currently undocumented and probably of very little use to anyone.

If you're interested in contributing, though, that would be pretty cool - let me
know and then I'll get to documenting the code and making what needs to be done
clear.
