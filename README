Cpp-Util

This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

If you're interested in contributing, that would be pretty cool - let me

clear.

TODO:
	array avl tree
	linked_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	exact_heap_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	fibheap (check file for TODOs)
	valgrind check everything
