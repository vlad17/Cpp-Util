Cpp-Util

This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

Requires cmake 2.6+ and gcc 4.7+

To run tests:
cmake .
make -j
make test

TODO:
        lock_free queue
        lfqueue testing
        condition variable wrapper pthreads
        add condition to lfqueue, test.
        stamped reference class (wait or lock free?)
        wait free queue
        wait free queue testing
        perf check wfqueue vs lfqueue
        Create exception-based test file - use multithreaded exceptions.
        create test-testandset spinlock, and then queuelock (with everyhting, Art of mpp ch.7) 
        Create assert-based tests
	concurrent heap_cache (finish testing & debugging)
	exact_heap_cache (see lfu_cache.h) - make separate method in main for comparison/stress
	linked_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	-> concurrent versions of exact_heap_cache and linked_cache
	fibheap (check file for TODOs)
	valgrind check everything
