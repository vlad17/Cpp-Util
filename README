Cpp-Util

This is a collection of some data structures I have been working on recently.

If you're interested in contributing, that would be pretty cool - let me
know and then I'll get to documenting the code and making what needs to be done
clear.

TODO:
	array avl tree
	debug block_ptr.h for complex data types
	document block_ptr.h
	linked_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	exact_heap_cache (see lfu_cache.h)
	fibheap (check file for TODOs)
	valgrind check everything
